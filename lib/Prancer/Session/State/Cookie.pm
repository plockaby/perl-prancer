=head1 NAME

Prancer::Session::State::Cookie

=head1 SYNOPSIS

THis module enables a session state handler. NOTE: One should not use this
module to connect to the database. Instead, one should use L<Prancer::Context>.

This module implements a session state handler. It will keep track of sessions
by setting cookies into the response headers and reading cookies in the request
headers. You must enable this if you want sessions to work.

To use this session state handler, add this to your configuration file:

    session:
        state:
            driver: Prancer::Session::State::Cookie
            options:
                key: PSESSION
                path: /
                domain: .example.com
                # expires in 30 minutes
                expires: 1800
                secure: 1
                httponly: 1
