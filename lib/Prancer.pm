=head1 NAME

Prancer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

When using as part of a web application:

    ===> foobar.yml

    session:
        state:
            driver: Prancer::Session::State::Cookie
            options:
                session_key: PSESSION
        store:
            driver: Prancer::Session::Store::Storable
            options:
                dir: /tmp/prancer/sessions

    static:
        path: /static
        dir: /srv/www/resources

    ===> myapp.psgi

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Plack::Runner;

    # this just returns a PSGI application. $x can be wrapped with additional
    # middleware before sending it along to Plack::Runner.
    my $x = MyApp->new("/path/to/foobar.yml")->to_psgi_app();

    # run the psgi app through Plack and send it everything from @ARGV. this
    # way Plack::Runner will get options like what listening port to use and
    # application server to use -- Starman, Twiggy, etc.
    my $runner = Plack::Runner->new();
    $runner->parse_options(@ARGV);
    $runner->run($x);

    ===> MyApp.pm

    package MyApp;

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Prancer qw(config);

    sub initialize {
        my $self = shift;

        # in here we can initialize things like plugins
        # but this method is not required to be implemented

        return;
    }

    sub handler {
        my ($self, $env, $request, $response, $session) = @_;

        sub (GET + /) {
            $response->header("Content-Type" => "text/plain");
            $response->body("Hello, world!");
            return $response->finalize(200);
        }, sub (GET + /foo) {
            $response->header("Content-Type" => "text/plain");
            $response->body(sub {
                my $writer = shift;
                $writer->write("Hello, world!");
                $writer->close();
                return;
            });
        }
    }

    1;

If you save the above snippet as C<myapp.psgi> and run it like this:

    plackup myapp.psgi

You will get "Hello, world!" in your browser. Or you can use Prancer as part of
a standalone command line application:

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Prancer::Core qw(config);

    # the advantage to using Prancer in a standalone application is the ability
    # to use a standard configuration and to load plugins for things like
    # loggers and database connectors and template engines.
    my $x = Prancer::Core->new("/path/to/foobar.yml");
    print "Hello, world!;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Prancer> is yet another PSGI framework that provides routing and session
management as well as plugins for logging, database access, and template
engines. It does this by wrapping L<Web::Simple> to handle routing and by
wrapping other libraries to bring easy access to things that need to be done in
web applications.

There are two parts to using Prancer for a web application: a package to
contain your application and a script to call your application. Both are
necessary.

Your package should contain a line like this:

    use Prancer;

This sets up your package such that it inherits from L<Prancer>. It also means
that your package must implement the C<handler> method and optionally implement
the C<initialize> method. As L<Prancer> inherits from L<Web::Simple> this will
also automatically enable the C<strict> and C<warnings> pragmas.

As mentioned, putting C<use Prancer;> at the top of your package will require
you to implement the C<handler> method, like this:

    sub handler {
        my ($self, $env, $request, $response, $session) = @_;

        # routing goes in here.
        # see Web::Simple for documentation on writing routing rules.
        sub (GET + /) {
            $response->header("Content-Type" => "text/plain");
            $response->body("Hello, world!");
            return $response->finalize(200);
        }
    }

The C<$request> variable is a L<Prancer::Request> object. The C<$response>
variable is a L<Prancer::Response> object. The C<$session> variable is a
L<Prancer::Session> object. If there is no configuration for sessions in any of
your configuration files then C<$session> will be C<undef>.

You may implement your own C<new> method in your package that uses L<Prancer>
but you B<MUST> call C<$class-E<gt>SUPER::new(@_);> to get the configuration
file loaded and any methods exported. As an alternative to implemeting C<new>
and remembering to call C<SUPER::new>, Prancer will make a call to
C<-E<gt>initialize> at the end of its own implementation of C<new> so things
that you might put in C<new> can instead be put into C<initialize>, like this:

    sub initialize {
        my $self = shift;

        # this is where you can initialize things when your package is created

        return;
    }

By default, L<Prancer> does not export anything into your package's namespace.
However, that doesn't mean that there is not anything that it I<could> export
were one to ask:

    use Prancer qw(config);

Importing C<config> will make the keyword C<config> available which gives
access to any configuration options loaded by the L<Prancer>.

The second part of the L<Prancer> equation is the script that creates and calls
your package. This can be a pretty small and standard little script, like this:

    my $myapp = MyApp->new("/path/to/foobar.yml")
    my $psgi = $myapp->to_psgi_app();

C<$myapp> is just an instance of your package. You can pass to C<new> either
one specific configuration file or a directory containing lots of configuration
files. The functionality is documented in C<Prancer::Config>.

C<$psgi> is just a PSGI app that you can send to L<Plack::Runner> or whatever
you use to run PSGI apps. You can also wrap middleware around C<$app>.

    my $psgi = $myapp->to_psgi_app();
    $psgi = Plack::Middleware::Runtime->wrap($psgi);

=head1 CONFIGURATION

L<Prancer> needs a configuration file. Ok, it doesn't I<need> a configuration
file. By default, L<Prancer> does not require any configuration. But it is less
useful without one. You I<could> always create your application like this:

    my $app = MyApp->new->to_psgi_app();

How L<Prancer> loads configuration files is documented in L<Prancer::Config>.
Anything you put into your configuration file is available to your application
but there are two exceptions to that rule. The key C<session> will configure
Prancer's session as documented in L<Prancer::Session>. The key C<static> will
configure static file loading through L<Plack::Middleware::Static>. These
configuration items are not made available to your application.

To configure static file loading you can add this to your configuration file:

    static:
        path: /static
        dir: /path/to/my/resources

The C<dir> option is required to indicate the root directory for your static
resources. The C<path> option indicates the web path to link to your static
resources. If no path is not provided then static files can be accessed under
C</static> by default.

=item

The name "Prancer" is a riff on the popular PSGI framework L<Dancer> and
L<Dancer2>. L<Prancer::Config> is derived directly from
L<Dancer2::Core::Role::Config>. Thank you to the
L<Dancer2|https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2> team.

=item

L<Prancer::Database> is derived from L<Dancer::Plugin::Database>. Thank you to
David Precious.

=item

L<Prancer::Request>, L<Prancer::Request::Upload>, L<Prancer::Response>,
L<Prancer::Session> and the session packages are but thin wrappers with minor
modifications to L<Plack::Request>, L<Plack::Request::Upload>,
L<Plack::Response>, and L<Plack::Middleware::Session>. Thank you to Tatsuhiko
Miyagawa.

=item

The entire routing functionality of this module is offloaded to L<Web::Simple>.
Thank you to Matt Trout for some great code that I am able to easily leverage.
